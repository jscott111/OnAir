This is a personal project for a raspberry pi which will connect to and fetch from my Google calendar to be able to light up a sign when I am in a meeting.

For this project you will need a raspberry pi device, IO cables and an LED or sign that you can wire up to the raspberry pi and turn it on or off with the GPIO.
